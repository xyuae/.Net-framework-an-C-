## Learning C# and Entity Framework in .Net 

## Introduction to collections
Another fundamental component of .Net is the collections library. Collectoins allow us to store data that can be grouped together because that is similiar. Collection also allow us to organie and sort data, as well as 
to iterate or go through the dta, such as in a loop. A collection is held in memory and is just a data structure component of .NET, whereas a database is usually held on disk and is a standalone application.
- Dictionaries for key-value pairs

## Asynchronous Programming
Let's start with an analogy. Traditional synchronous, or non-asynchronous, programming is like decising to bild a house. you start with a foundatoin, then bjuild a frame, blumbing, electrical and so on. On the 
other hand, asynchronous programming is like deciding to build a house, but instead of doing it all yourself, you decide to hire a contractor to do the foundation, another on plumbing, and another for electrical. And at the 
same time you are free to do other things, such as progect manage. 
- Async and Await to manage program flow
- Anonymous functioins, callbacks, and action to manage prorgam flow

### Combine Aspects of Fields and Methods with Class Properties
- Properties
- Auto-implemented propertie for more compact code

### Optimize Applications with Multithreading
- creating a new thread

### Set Default values with Null Coalescing and Null Conditional Operators
